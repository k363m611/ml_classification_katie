# Titanic Survival Prediction

**Author:** Katie  
**Date:** April 6, 2025  

## Project Overview

This project builds a machine learning model to predict survival outcomes of Titanic passengers. Using a cleaned and preprocessed version of the [Kaggle Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data), the goal is to explore features, train classifiers, and compare model performance in order to draw insights from passenger data.
